My repo is located at:

https://github.com/koenigone/Cantor-Colllege-Assessment

## CONFIRMATION OF FILES

I confirm I have zipped the files in the format of:
├── evidence
│   ├── lighthouse-audits
│   ├── wireframes
│   ├── database
├── website_code
│   ├── /src
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── .gitignore


I confirm I have only included files needed to run the application.

## ADVICE ON SUBMISSION

Do not include the `node_modules` or `.next` folders.  These large folder can be recreated for marking via `npm install` so do ensure your `package.json` file is included.

The `website_code` folder should hold only the files **used** in your project.

If you have used a database include an SQL dump of the SQL used.

Please do not re-submit the `website-images-assets` and `web-site-text-and-data`.  We don't want them back!  It is **LAZY** to include them!
