        The Library and Resource Centre rules apply in principle to all sites, including workstation
        rooms and site libraries, notwithstanding some variations in practice in the site libraries.
        Admission to the Library and Resource Centre is conditional upon observation of the rules,
        and the staff are empowered to enforce them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Library and Resource Centre Disciplinary
        Action, including the withdrawal of some access. If appropriate, action may involve invoking
        the Collegeâ€™s Regulations for Students, or in the case of staff, through the appropriate
        College procedures as set out in the Staff Handbook.
