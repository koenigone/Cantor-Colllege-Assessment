      <h1>Rules Governing the Use of the Library and Resource Centre</h1>
      <p>
        All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Library
        and Resource Centre and to use the facilities for the purpose of their course of study or
        College employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated from other
        organisations: a fee is usually charged. Access to the Library and Resource Centre for
        study purposes may be made available to non-members by arrangement. Details are available
        in the External Services leaflet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of facilities implies acceptance of the Library and Resource Centre rules printed
        below. These are designed to protect the interests of all users of Library and Resource
        Centre and to ensure that the College operates within the law and can carry out its
        functions efficiently and effectively.
